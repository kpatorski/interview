## JWT - JSON Web Token

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a self-contained token used to transfer information about a user or a session in a way that is:

- **cryptographically signed** → guarantees integrity (i.e. no one has modified it),
- **not encrypted** (unless you use JWE).

JWT is mainly used for:
- authentication,
- authorization,
- delegating access between services.

It is a lightweight alternative to sessions — **no state is stored on the server**.

---

### ℹ️ What does a JWT consist of?

`header.payload.signature`

**Header**

Contains metadata: the algorithm and token type:

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

**Payload**

Contains claims — information about the user and the token:

```json
{
  "sub": "123456",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1710000000,
  "exp": 1710003600,
  "role": "ADMIN"
}
```

**Signature**

The cryptographic signature is created from:

```java
HMACSHA256(
    base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
    secretKey
)
```

---

### ℹ️ How does encryption relate to this?

JWT is **<span style='color:hotpink'>NOT</span>** encrypted.  
It is **<span style='color:forestgreen'>only</span>** signed.

That means:

- ⚠️ anyone can read the payload,
- ✅ but no one can modify it without breaking the signature.

If you want to encrypt the token → use **JWE** (JSON Web Encryption).  
In that case, the payload element is encrypted and unreadable.
---

### ℹ️ Who creates JWTs?

JWTs are created by an Authorization Server, for example:
- Keycloak
- Auth0
- Google, Apple, GitHub (OIDC / OAuth2 providers)
- Your backend (e.g. Spring Security + a custom issuer)

**Process**:

1. The user logs in
2. The server verifies the password / OIDC provider,
3. The server generates a JWT and signs it with a private key,
4. The client (frontend/mobile) uses the JWT in Authorization: Bearer.

⚠️ The backend should not generate JWTs arbitrarily on its own.
This is the responsibility of the Authorization Server.

---

### ℹ️ Why is JWT used?

✅ User authentication

After logging in, the client receives an access token — a JWT — which it uses to identify itself with every request.

✅ Authorization

JWT can contain roles, permissions, and scopes.

✅ Access delegation (OAuth2)

API A can send a JWT to API B without requiring the user to log in again.

✅ Statelessness

The server does not store sessions → **no need** for:

- sticky sessions,
- session replication,
- storing sessions in Redis.

✅ Speed and scalability

The backend verifies the signature locally, without querying the database.

✅ Communication between microservices

Each service can verify the JWT signature and trust its claims.

---

### ℹ️ JWT vs JWS vs JWE — how they relate

#### 🔶 JWT — the umbrella concept

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a token format, not a cryptographic mechanism.

JWT defines:

- the data structure
- the serialization format
- standard claims (e.g. sub, exp, iss)

A JWT can be:

- signed → **JWS**
- encrypted → **JWE**

signed and encrypted → JWS wrapped in JWE

#### 🔶 JWS — Signed JWT (most common case)

🔐 JWS = JWT + digital signature

This is what most people mean when they say “JWT”.

JWS structure

> header.payload.signature

- header → signing algorithm (RS256, ES256, HS256)
- payload → claims (sub, exp, roles, etc.)
- signature → digital signature

What does JWS provide?

✅ Integrity  
✅ Authentication  
✅ Non-repudiation  
❌ Confidentiality (the payload is readable, only Base64URL-encoded)  

⚠️ Base64 ≠ encryption

Example JWS

`eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjMiLCJyb2xlIjoiQURNSU4ifQ.<signature>`

Anyone can:

- read the payload
- verify the signature

But no one can modify the token without breaking the signature.

#### 🔶 JWE — Encrypted JWT

🔐 JWE = JWT + encryption

JWE hides the payload — the token contents are unreadable.

JWE structure (5 parts)

> header.encryptedKey.iv.ciphertext.tag

| Part         | Meaning                   |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| header       | encryption algorithms     |
| encryptedKey | encrypted symmetric key   |
| iv           | initialization vector     |
| ciphertext   | encrypted payload         |
| tag          | authentication tag (AEAD) |


📌 This is NOT header.payload.signature

What does JWE provide?

✅ Confidentiality  
✅ Integrity  
✅ Authentication (cryptographic)  
❌ Non-repudiation (by itself)  

---

### 🧨 Most common mistakes a senior should catch immediately

- Storing JWT in localStorage → vulnerable to XSS.
- JWT without expiration → a security killer.
- Putting personal data into JWT ("because nobody can read it") → wrong.
- No key rotation (JWKS).
- Leaving Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * together with credentials → not allowed.
- Using OAuth2 for login without OIDC (empty id_token).
- Sending refresh tokens via JavaScript → they should be stored in httpOnly secure cookies.
- Disabling TLS in dev/prod "because it’s easier".

---

### Questions

**Question 1**: What is JWT made of?

1. **Header**
   Typically consists of two parts: the type of the token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 (HS256) or RSA (RS256).  
   Example: `{"alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT"}`
2. **Payload**
   The payload contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional data. Claims are divided into three types:
   - **Registered claims**: Standard claims like issuer (iss), expiration time (exp), and subject (sub).
   - **Public claims**: Custom claims defined by the application.
   - **Private claims**: Custom claims used to share information between parties.
3. **Signature**
   The signature is used to verify that the token has not been tampered with. 
   It is created by taking the encoded header, the encoded payload, and a secret key, then signing them using the algorithm specified in the header.

**Question 2**: Why is JWT considered as secure?

JWTs are considered secure because they use cryptographic signatures to **<span style='color:darkseagreen'>ensure integrity</span>** and **<span style='color:darkseagreen'>authenticity</span>**, **<span style='color:darkseagreen'>preventing tampering</span>**; they are self-contained, allowing stateless authentication; and the signature verifies the sender, ensuring the server trusts the token's claims without needing a database lookup on every request.

**Question 3**: What is the JWT used for?

They are used for **<span style='color:darkseagreen'>securely transmitting information</span>** between parties as a compact, primarily **<span style='color:darkseagreen'>for authentication and authorization</span>** in APIs, enabling stateless, scalable systems like microservices and Single Sign-On (SSO) by carrying user identity and permissions directly in the token, avoiding server-side session storage.  
They act like a digital ⭕️"**wristband**"⭕️, **verifying identity** and **authorized** actions without repeated database lookups, ensuring data integrity through cryptographic signatures.

## Encryption

### ℹ️ What is encryption?

Encryption is the process of transforming readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) using a cryptographic key.

The goal is to ensure:

- **Confidentiality** → no one except the authorized recipient can read the data
- (sometimes) **Integrity** and **Authentication**, if the algorithm supports it

In web systems, encryption is a foundation of:
- HTTPS / TLS
- JWE
- data storage
- data exchange between services

---

### ℹ️ What types of encryption exist?

There are two basic types:

#### 🔶 Symmetric encryption

🔑 Uses a **single** shared key -> **the same key** is used for encryption and decryption

Example algorithms: 
- `AES-128 / AES-256`
- `ChaCha20`

Use cases:

- database encryption
- file encryption
- part of JWE operations
- internal systems

✅ Pros: fast, efficient  
⚠️ Cons: key distribution problem (the key must be securely shared with the other party)

#### 🔶 Asymmetric encryption

Uses two different keys:

🔑 Public Key – can be shared with anyone  
🔐 Private Key – must remain secret

Mechanism:  
`encryption → 🔑 public key`  
`decryption → 🔐 private key`

Example algorithms:

- RSA
- ECC (e.g. ES256, ES512)

Use cases:

- TLS / certificates
- digital signatures
- JWT signing (RS256, ES256)
- SSH
- PGP keys

✅ Pros: secure data exchange over the Internet  
⚠️ Cons: slower than symmetric encryption  

---

### ℹ️ How does it work in practice?

#### 🔶 Asymmetric encryption (public / private keys)
##### 🔹 Encryption

The sender encrypts the message using the recipient’s public key. 

❗**Only** the **recipient** can decrypt it (they own the private key)

`🔑 Public Key (recipient)  → encrypts`  
`🔐 Private Key (recipient) → decrypts`  

> Alice (sender) encrypts a message using Bob’s public key  
> Bob (receiver) decrypts it using his private key

Purpose:

- secure key exchange
- secure delivery of secrets over the Internet

##### 🔹 Digital signature (not the same as encryption)

`🔐 Private Key → signs`    
`🔑 Public Key  → verifies`  

> Bob signs a message with her private key  
> Alice can verify it using Bob’s public key

Provides:

- integrity
- authentication
- non-repudiation

This is exactly what JWT (JWS) does with RS256 / ES256 algorithms.

#### 🔶 Symmetric encryption (shared secret key)

##### 🔹 Encryption and decryption

Both parties use the same shared 🔏secret key🔏

The key must be known to both sides in advance

`🔏 Shared Secret Key → encrypts`   
`🔏 Shared Secret Key → decrypts`  

Key characteristics:

❌ no public/private key pair 🔑/🔐  
✅ very fast and efficient  
⚠️ security depends entirely on key secrecy

##### 🔹 Integrity and authentication (optional)

Symmetric encryption alone provides confidentiality only.

To ensure integrity and authentication, systems use:

- MAC (Message Authentication Code)
- HMAC (e.g. HMAC-SHA256)

Mechanism:

> Sender creates a MAC using the shared key 🔏  
> Recipient recomputes and verifies the MAC  

```
🔏 Shared Secret Key → encrypts data  
🔏 Shared Secret Key → creates MAC  
🔏 Shared Secret Key → verifies MAC
```

If verification succeeds:

- the message was not modified
- the sender knew the shared secret

##### 🔹 Authenticated encryption (AEAD)

Modern systems prefer **AEAD** modes, which combine:

- encryption
- integrity
- authentication

in a single operation.

Examples:

- AES-GCM
- ChaCha20-Poly1305

These modes eliminate the need for a separate MAC.

#### 🔶 Why both are used together

Each approach solves a different problem:

| Problem                               | Solution              |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Secure key exchange over the Internet | Asymmetric encryption |
| Fast encryption of large data         | Symmetric encryption  |
| Identity verification                 | Digital signatures    |
| Message integrity                     | Signatures / MAC      |


#### 🔶 Typical real-world flow (example: TLS)

🔐 **The Core Idea of TLS**

TLS uses:

1. Asymmetric cryptography → only during the handshake
2. Symmetric cryptography → for all actual data (request and response)

Asymmetric crypto is used to:

- authenticate the server
- securely agree on a shared session key

Symmetric crypto is used to:

- encrypt all HTTP traffic in both directions

🧠 **What Actually Happens (TLS 1.3 – simplified)**

1️⃣ **ClientHello**

The client (browser):

- says it wants TLS
- sends supported cipher suites
- sends key exchange data (ECDHE parameters)

2️⃣ **ServerHello**

The server responds with:

- chosen cipher suite
- its certificate (contains public key)
- its own key exchange data
- a digital signature created with its private key

Important:

👉 **The private key is used only for signing (authentication), not for encrypting the response.**

3️⃣ **Key Agreement (ECDHE)**

Both sides:

- use Diffie-Hellman (usually ECDHE)
- compute the same shared secret independently

**From that, they derive:**

🔑 **A symmetric session key**

🔐 **From This Point On**

Everything is encrypted symmetrically:

- HTTP request → encrypted
- HTTP response → encrypted

Usually with:

`AES-GCM`  or `ChaCha20-Poly1305`

📌 **A network sniffer sees only encrypted blobs.**

#### 🔶 Key takeaway

**Asymmetric cryptography answers:**
> “Who are you and how do we safely exchange secrets?”

**Symmetric cryptography answers:**
> “How do we efficiently protect large amounts of data?”

---


### ℹ️ 🔐 Encryption vs ✍️ Digital Signature

#### 🔶 Encryption

Question encryption answers:
> “Can an unauthorized party read the data?”

What does it do?

- Hides the content of data
- Transforms plaintext → ciphertext
- Protects CONFIDENTIALITY

Who can read the data?

Only the owner of the **<span style='color:green'>private</span>** key 🔐

What does it provide?

✅ Confidentiality  
❌ Integrity (without additional mechanisms)  
❌ Authentication  
❌ Non-repudiation  

#### 🔶 Digital Signature

Question a digital signature answers:
> “Who created the data and has it been modified?”

What does it do?

- Does NOT hide the data
- Creates proof of authorship and integrity
- Protects INTEGRITY, AUTHENTICATION, NON-REPUDIATION

Who can verify the signature?

Anyone who has the sender’s **<span style='color:green'>public</span>** key 🔑

What does it provide?

❌ Confidentiality  
✅ Integrity  
✅ Authentication  
✅ Non-repudiation  

#### 🔶 Examples

- **JWT**
  - JWS (RS256 / ES256) → digital signature (integrity + authentication)
  - JWE → encryption (confidentiality)

- **TLS**
  - Certificate → CA signature (trust)
  - Handshake → signatures + asymmetric crypto
  - Session → symmetric encryption

---


### ℹ️ Why all this? (Goals of encryption)

✅ Confidentiality  

Data is unreadable to intruders 😈

✅ Integrity  

Data has not been modified ✍🏻 (digital signature, MAC). 

✅ Authentication  

I can prove I am communicating with:

- a real server (TLS certificate),
- a real user (JWT signature),
- a real application (mTLS).

✅ Non-repudiation  
The sender cannot deny having signed the data with their private key.

---


### ℹ️ Who creates the keys?

It depends on the context.

✔️ **TLS / HTTPS**  

Keys are generated by:
- the server → generates its own key pair (private/public)
- the CA → signs the public certificate

✔️ **JWT (RS256 / ES256)**

Keys are created by the Authorization Server, e.g.:

- Keycloak
- OAuth2 Authorization Server in Spring Security
- Auth0
- Google Identity

The user never creates JWT keys — the issuer does.

✔️ **JWE (encrypted JWT)**

Anyone encrypting a token needs the recipient’s public key.

✔️ **SSH**

Keys are generated by the user (ssh-keygen).

<div style="break-after: page;"></div>

### SSL / TLS

#### ℹ️ What is it?

**SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)** are cryptographic protocols that secure internet communication, providing privacy, authentication, and data integrity between a client (like a web browser) and a server, often seen as HTTPS.
While SSL was the original protocol, it has been replaced by the more secure and modern TLS, but the term "SSL" is still commonly used to refer to the technology. 
It works by establishing an encrypted connection using certificates, preventing eavesdropping and tampering with sensitive data like passwords and payment info.

---

#### ℹ️ How it works (Simplified)

1. **Handshake**: Your browser 🖥️ connects to a website 🌐, and the server 🗄️ sends its **SSL/TLS** certificate 🪪.
2. **Verification**: Your browser 🖥️ verifies the certificate 🪪 to ensure the site is legitimate.
3. **Key Exchange**: Using public-key 🔑 (asymmetric) encryption, the client and server securely agree on a shared secret key🔏.
4. **Encrypted Communication**: All subsequent data is encrypted and decrypted using that shared secret key🔏 (symmetric encryption), making it unreadable to outsiders.

---

#### ℹ️ Key Functions

✅ **Privacy**: Encrypts data so only the intended recipient can read it.  
✅ **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the website or server.  
✅ **Integrity**: Ensures data hasn't been altered in transit.  

---

#### ℹ️ SSL vs. TLS

- SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): The older, now deprecated protocol with security vulnerabilities.
- TLS (Transport Layer Security): The current, updated, and more secure standard, with versions like TLS 1.2 and 1.3 actively used.
- Interchangeable Terms: Most services offering "SSL" today actually provide TLS encryption due to its widespread adoption and security, notes Amazon Web Services.

--- 
<div style="break-after: page;"></div>

### Questions

**Question 1**: What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?  

The primary difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption is the number of keys used to protect data.  
Symmetric encryption relies on a single shared key, while asymmetric encryption uses a mathematically linked pair of public and private keys.

**Question 2**: What is TLS?

ℹ️ **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**  
- **Authentication**: One-way (Server to Client). The client verifies the server's identity using a server certificate issued by a public Certificate Authority (CA).
- **Purpose**: Secures public-facing websites and general internet traffic (e.g., HTTPS).
- **Process**: Client connects, server presents its certificate, client validates it, and a secure connection is established.

**Question 3**: What is mTLS?  

ℹ️ **mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security)**  

- **Authentication**: Two-way (Client and Server). Both present and verify each other's certificates.
- **Purpose**: High-security applications, internal service-to-service communication (microservices, APIs), IoT, zero-trust networks.
- **Process**: After standard TLS handshake steps, the server requests a client certificate, which the client provides and the server validates, ensuring both parties are trusted.

---
<div style="break-after: page;"></div>

## Keystore vs Truststore

### ℹ️ What is a keystore?

A keystore is a storage for a server’s private keys 🔐 and certificates. 📝

**Technically:**  
a file that contains private keys and often their corresponding X.509 certificates.

**Common formats:**

- .jks (Java Keystore – legacy format)
- .p12 / .pfx (PKCS#12 – modern standard)
- .pem + .key (OpenSSL formats)

✔️ A keystore stores:

- the server’s private keys 🔐
- their certificates 📝 (public key + subject data + CA signature)

❗Keystore = server identity.❗

**<span style='color:darkseagreen'>The server must prove its identity</span>** during the **TLS** handshake → therefore the private key 🔐 **<span style='color:darkseagreen'>must exist only on the server</span>** and nowhere else.

---

### ℹ️ What is a truststore?

A truststore is a storage of certificates 📝 that a server 🗄️ trusts. 🤝

✔️ A truststore contains:

- CA certificates the server trusts
- certificates of other services (in mTLS)

❗Truststore = a list of trusted issuers.❗

For an HTTP server:

- a truststore is required when the server acts as an HTTPS client (e.g. sending requests to another API)

Example:

`Spring Boot reads from the truststore to determine which CAs it trusts`

---

### ℹ️ How do keystore and truststore relate to encryption and signatures?

🔶 **Keystore → private key**

Used for:

- signing the TLS handshake
- decrypting data (pre-master secrets) in older TLS versions
- issuing JWTs (when the server is an Authorization Server)
- signing JWS tokens

❗Private key = always stored only in the keystore.❗

---

🔶 **Truststore → CA public keys**

Used for:

- verifying whether a server certificate was issued by a trusted CA
- validating the certificate chain (root CA → intermediate CA → server certificate)

Browsers have their own truststores:

- Chrome, Safari, Firefox ship with built-in trusted CAs
- therefore they can verify server certificates without extra configuration

Servers also have truststores:

- Java uses the default cacerts
- you can add custom certificates (e.g. internal company CAs)

---

### ℹ️ Examples

#### 🔶 Example 1 – User visits an HTTPS website (TLS handshake)  

🧭 **Step 1: Browser → Server**

The browser sends:

- `ClientHello`

Contains:

- supported protocols (TLS 1.2 / TLS 1.3)
- supported cipher suites
- random value (nonce)

🧭 **Step 2: Server → Browser**

The server responds with:

- `ServerHello + Certificate`

Where:

- Certificate is an X.509 certificate containing the server’s public key
- the certificate is signed by a CA (e.g. Let’s Encrypt)
- the backend loads the certificate from the keystore

🧭 **Step 3: Browser validates the certificate using the truststore**

The browser checks:  
✔️ whether the certificate was issued by a CA present in the truststore  
✔️ whether the certificate is within its validity period  
✔️ whether the domain matches the certificate (e.g. the certificate is for example.com and the request goes to example.com)  

If any check fails → the browser shows an SSL error.

🧭 **Step 4: Session key creation**

In TLS 1.3 (simplified view):

- the browser generates a session key (**AES**)
- encrypts it using the server’s public key from the certificate
- the server decrypts it using its private key from the keystore

Now both sides share the same AES key → encrypted communication can begin.

🧭 **Step 5: Encrypted communication**

The parties now communicate over an encrypted channel:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

Everything is encrypted:

- headers
- cookies
- bearer token
- payload

---

#### 🔶 Example 2 – Microservice (A) → Microservice (B) in a private network (HTTPS)

Service A sends a request to Service B.

🔹 Service **A** needs a truststore
→ to verify Service **B’s** certificate

🔹 Service **B** needs a keystore
→ to present its identity

This works exactly the same as browser ↔ server communication.

---

#### 🔶 Example 3 – mTLS (mutual TLS)

In mTLS:

- the server presents its certificate (from its keystore)
- the client (e.g. another service) also presents its certificate (from its own keystore)

Then:

- the server verifies the client certificate using its truststore
- the client verifies the server certificate using its truststore

This **<span style='color:darkseagreen'>acts as mutual identity verification</span>** — a “two-way proof of identity”.

## Public vs private key

### ℹ️ What is a key pair?

A key pair consists of two mathematically related keys:

- Public key 🔑 → can be shared with anyone
- Private key 🔐 → known only to the owner (server, application, user)

📌 Core principle:

> What is encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other.

---

### ℹ️ Two uses of the same key pair
#### 🔶 Use case A — Data encryption

**When do we use the public key?**  
When a client wants to send data securely to a server:

- The client encrypts the data using the server’s public key
- Only the server can decrypt it, because it owns the private key

#### 🔶 Use case B — Data signing (digital signature)

Here the process is reversed:

- The server signs data using its private key
- Anyone can verify the signature using the public key

➡️ This is how JWTs work with RSA / EC algorithms. 
➡️ This is how SSL/TLS certificates work  
➡️ This is how electronic (qualified) signatures work  

---

### ℹ️ Why does this work?

The mathematics of asymmetric cryptography (RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519) ensures that:

- Knowing the public key 🔑 **<span style='color:deeppink'>does not allow</span>** reconstructing the private key 🔐
- Yet both keys are mathematically linked, so that:
  - 📌 **one key encrypts, the other decrypts**
  - 📌 **one key signs, the other verifies**

---

### ℹ️ How does this look in practice?
#### 🔶 TLS / HTTPS

The server has in its keystore:

- an X.509 certificate
- a private key

The client retrieves the certificate → obtains the trusted public key.  
The client encrypts the session key using the public key → only the server can decrypt it.

#### 🔶 Signed JWT (JWS)

- The Authorization Server owns the private key
- It uses it to sign JWTs
- The Resource Server retrieves the public key from /jwks.json
- It verifies the signature → no need to trust or know the private key

This is why microservices do not need a shared secret.

#### 🔶 SSH

Each developer has:

- private key 🔐 → `.ssh/id_rsa`
- public key 🔑 → `.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

The server stores **only** the public key 🔑, to verify that login signatures were created using the corresponding private key.

---

### ℹ️ Most important rules

🔑 **Public key**:

✔️ can be shared with anyone  
✔️ can be published on a website  
✔️ cannot decrypt data encrypted with the private key  
✔️ cannot generate a valid signature  

🔐 **Private key**:

❗ must remain strictly secret  
❗ must never leave the server  
❗ must never be committed to a repository  
❗ if compromised → the certificate or system must be replaced  

---

### ℹ️ The simplest possible metaphor

Imagine a mailbox:

- **Public key = the mail slot**  
  Anyone can drop a letter in (encrypt data).
- **Private key = the key to open the mailbox**  
  Only the owner can open it and read the contents.

Now the other side (digital signature):

- **Private key = your personal wax seal**  
  Only you can seal (sign) a letter.
- **Public key = the publicly known seal pattern**  
  Anyone can compare the seal and confirm authenticity.

---

### ℹ️ Three-sentence summary

🔑 The public key is used for encryption or signature verification and can be publicly distributed.  
🔐 The private key is used for decryption or signing and must remain secret at all times.  
Asymmetry means that knowing one key does not allow reconstructing the other, yet enables paired cryptographic operations.

## 🌐 CORS — Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

### ℹ️ What is CORS?

> CORS is a browser security mechanism that controls:  
> whether a web page from one origin is allowed to make an HTTP request to another origin.

📌 CORS <span style='color:hotpink'>**is not**</span> a backend security mechanism  
📌 CORS <span style='color:hotpink'>**does not**</span> apply to server-to-server communication  
📌 CORS <span style='color:forestgreen'>**applies only**</span> to web browsers  

### ℹ️ Why does CORS exist?

CORS is a consequence of the Same-Origin Policy (SOP).

> A script can freely communicate only with the same origin.

`Origin = scheme + host + port` e.g.: https://example.com:443

Changing any of these creates a different origin.

### ℹ️ What exactly does CORS block?

CORS does not block the request itself.

- The request is sent  
- The server may process it  
- But the browser may block the response  

Meaning:

- the backend receives the request
- the frontend does not get access to the response

### ℹ️ When does a CORS problem occur?

Frontend: https://app.example.com  
Backend:  https://api.example.com

From the browser’s perspective, these are two different origins.  
⚠️ If the backend does not explicitly allow this → CORS error.

### ℹ️ How does CORS work technically?

🔶 **1. Simple request**

A request is considered simple if it:

- uses `GET`, `POST`, or `HEAD`
- uses only simple headers
- has no custom headers

The browser:

- sends the request
- checks the response header: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

✅ <span style='color:darkseagreen'>If it matches</span> → the response is exposed to JavaScript  
❌ <span style='color:hotpink'>If not</span> → the response is blocked

🔶 **2. Preflight request (OPTIONS)**

For “non-simple” requests:

- `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`
- custom headers (e.g. Authorization)
- `Content-Type: application/json`

The browser first sends:

- `OPTIONS /api/resource` 

Asking:

> “Am I allowed to send the real request?”

🔶 **3. Preflight — what does the browser check?**

The backend must respond with:

```javascript
Access-Control-Allow-Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Methods
Access-Control-Allow-Headers
```

If the response is valid:  
✅ the browser **sends** the **actual** request

If not:  
❌ the request is **never** sent

### ℹ️ Most important CORS headers

🔸 **Response headers (from backend)**

```javascript
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

🔸 **Request headers (from browser)**

`Origin: https://app.example.com`

### ℹ️ Credentials and CORS (very important)

If you use:

- cookies
- Authorization header
- sessions

You **must** satisfy both conditions:

```javascript
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: MUST NOT be "*"
```

❌ This is invalid:

```javascript
Allow-Origin: *
Allow-Credentials: true
```

### ℹ️ CORS and JWT

🔸 JWT in the Authorization header

`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`

- This is a custom header
- It triggers a preflight request

⚠️ The backend must explicitly allow:

`Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization`

### ℹ️ CORS ≠ backend security

This is critical to understand:

❌ CORS **does not secure** your API  
❌ CORS **does not replace** authentication  
❌ CORS **does not block** curl / Postman / backend clients  

✔ CORS protects the browser user

If an endpoint has no authentication:

- curl can call it
- another backend can call it
- the browser is the only one restricted

### ℹ️ Three-sentence summary

CORS is a browser mechanism that controls cross-origin access to HTTP responses.
The backend declares CORS policy via headers, but the browser enforces it.
CORS does not secure APIs — it protects browser users.

## 🔐 Authentication, Authorization, LDAP, OAuth — core identity concepts

### ℹ️ Authentication (AuthN)

Authentication answers the question:

> “Who are you?”

It is the process of verifying identity.

🔸 **How authentication works**

A system checks proof of identity, for example:

- username + password
- certificate (TLS / mTLS)
- token (JWT)
- biometric data
- hardware key (FIDO2)

If verification <span style='color:darkseagreen'>**succeeds**</span> ➡️ the user/service is authenticated

If it <span style='color:hotpink'>**fails**</span> ➡️ access is denied immediately

🔸 **Examples**

- Logging in with email + password
- TLS client certificate authentication
- Verifying a JWT signature
- SSH key-based login

🔸 **What authentication provides**

✅ Identity verification      
❌ No permission information  
❌ No access control  

### ℹ️ Authorization (AuthZ)

Authorization answers the question:

> “What are you allowed to do?”

It happens after authentication.

🔸 **How authorization works**

The system checks:
- roles
- permissions
- scopes
- policies

Based on identity + rules, the system decides:  
➡️ <span style='color:darkseagreen'>**allow**</span> or <span style='color:hotpink'>**deny**</span> access to a resource or action

🔸 **Examples**

- ADMIN can create users
- USER can only read data
- JWT scope orders:read
- RBAC / ABAC policies

🔸 **What authorization provides**

✅ Access control  
✅ Resource protection  
❌ Identity verification  

🔸 **AuthN vs AuthZ (critical distinction)**

| Question         | Concept        |
|------------------|----------------|
| Who are you?     | Authentication |
| What can you do? | Authorization  |
	
❗ You **cannot** authorize without authentication

### ℹ️ LDAP

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a directory protocol used to:

- store user identities
- authenticate users
- organize users and groups hierarchically

LDAP **is not** an auth framework — it is a directory + protocol.

🔸 **What LDAP stores**

- users
- passwords (hashed)
- groups
- organizational structure

**Example structure:**

```
dc=company,dc=com
├── ou=people
│    └── uid=john
└── ou=groups
└── cn=admins
```

🔸 **What LDAP is used for**

- Authentication (username + password)
- User lookup
- Group membership resolution

🔸 **What LDAP does NOT do**

❌ Token issuance  
❌ Delegated authorization  
❌ OAuth flows  

🔸 **Typical LDAP systems**

- Active Directory
- OpenLDAP
- FreeIPA

### ℹ️ OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework, not an authentication protocol.

OAuth answers:

> “Is this client allowed to access this resource on behalf of someone?”

🔸 **OAuth roles**

| Role                 | Meaning       |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Resource Owner       | user          |
| Client               | application   |
| Authorization Server | issues tokens |
| Resource Server      | protects APIs |


🔸 **What OAuth provides**

✅ Delegated authorization  
✅ Access tokens  
✅ Scopes & consent

🔸 **What OAuth does NOT provide**

❌ Authentication by itself  
❌ User identity verification (without extensions)  

### ℹ️ OAuth vs Authentication

OAuth tokens <span style='color:darkseagreen'>**answer**</span>:

> “What can this token access?”

They <span style='color:hotpink'>**do not**</span> answer:

> “Who is the user?”

That’s why:

📌 OAuth ≠ login  
📌 OAuth ≠ authentication  

### ℹ️ How these concepts work together

**Example:** `Web application login`

1. User opens frontend
2. Frontend redirects to Authorization Server
3. User authenticates (password, MFA, etc.)
4. Authorization Server:
   1. authenticates the user
   2. authorizes scopes
   3. issues tokens (JWT)
5. Frontend calls backend with Access Token
6. Backend:
   1. authenticates token (signature)
   2. authorizes request (roles/scopes)

### ℹ️ LDAP vs OAuth vs JWT

| Concept        | Purpose                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| LDAP           | User directory & authentication |
| OAuth          | Delegated authorization         |
| JWT            | Token format                    |
| Authentication | Identity verification           |
| Authorization  | Access control                  |

### ℹ️ Mental models (remember this)

- Authentication → **Who are you?**
- Authorization → **What can you do?**
- LDAP → **Where users and groups live**
- OAuth → **Who is allowed to access what, on whose behalf**

### ℹ️ Three-sentence summary

Authentication verifies identity, authorization decides permissions.  
LDAP is a directory used for storing users and authenticating them, not a token system.  
OAuth is an authorization framework that issues access tokens, while OpenID Connect adds authentication on top.
